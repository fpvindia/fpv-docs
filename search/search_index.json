It houses all the components that make up the drone. Quadcopters usually have frames that are made of Carbon Fiber (smaller ones have plastic frames). These come in two main categories: lightweight compact frames designed for drone racing, and freestyle frames, which are usually slightly larger than racing frames, more durable and slightly heavier too. Choosing the right frame for your FPV drone \u00b6 There are a lot of things that we need to consider when selecting a frame for the drones. Let's discuss the main ones: Propeller Size - Depending on the length of the arms of the frame, specific propeller sizes will be needed. Most common are 5\" and 3\" propellers, and drone frames usually support them well. Usable Internal Space - When selecting a frame, we need to consider the space available inside the frame for mounting the components. Does the frame have the right mounting-holes? Does it come with the right amount of space for all the components we will be putting into it (FC, ESC, Camera, battery, radio, antenna, etc) Aerodynamics - How well does the drone slice through the air? Bulky drones tend to meet with higher air resistance and will need more power to fly through the air. A thin nimble frame will cut through much easier and with lesser effort. Strength - A strong frame will survive many crashes before it breaks apart. A lightweight frame, on the other hand would break apart a bit more easily as they don't have the strength to withstand heavy crashes or drops. However, this can be a double-edged sword - a stronger drone would be heavier, and would need more power to fly. So a balance would need to be struck between strength and weight. Frames with 4mm thick plates are pretty durable and strong (but slightly heavier too). Also, 3mm thick frames are also available but will not be quite as strong. Additional Features - Some well designed frames come with some extra features. For example, some come with overarching support rungs that protect the camera in case of a head-on collision. Others come with capabilities to mount additional cameras like GoPros. Yet others come with power distribution boards that allow you to properly distribute power from the ESC to the motors. We recommend beginners to go with freestyle 4mm thick 5\" frames instead of thinner racing-style frames, for obvious reasons Power Distribution Board (PDB) \u00b6 Power Distribution Boards (or PDBs) are circuit boards that help pass power from the drone battery to the various components of the drone. While these were very popular in recent times, many modern Flight Controllers (FC) come with a PDB inbuilt into the circuit, making a separate PDB unnecessary. These usually come with many frames, and can also be separately bought if required. In our build, we use a Flight Controller that already has an integrated PDB, and this component is not required. Useful tips for choosing the right freestyle frames \u00b6 The frame houses all the components of the drone, and hence, must be carefully chosen. There are a bunch of different designs, shapes and sizes available for frames today, and here we list some good pointers that we believe, will help you make a good buying decision. Size - Drone frames are usually categorized by their ability of housing propellers. For instance, a 5-inch drone frame is not a frame that has a dimension of 5 inches - instead, the 5 inches refers to the fact that the frame is designed to work with 5-inch propellers. Shape - Care must be taken to ensure that the drone has a form factor that supports the components you buy. For instance, some drone frames have a small form factor, and may not have enough space to host additional components that you may have thought of for your build. Other drone frames may not be designed to host some of the components you may have in mind. For instance, we have seen that some drone frames just do not have space for a DJI Air unit, and we would have to mount it underneath (exposing the air unit and possibly opening it up for damage during an unfortunate crash) or have a custom 3D-printed mount created to support it. Mounting holes - Most new freestyle frames come with support for the two most common form factors of the Flight Controller - ESC combo (30.5mm by 30.5mm) or (20mm by 20mm). However, there are many frames out there that support only one of these two mounting types. Hence, care must be taken to ensure that the frame supports the mounting size that the flight controller comes in. Weight - This one is a no-brainer, but we need to have this on the list nonetheless. A drone's weight will decide it's responsiveness. A drone that is too heavy will be sluggish and may not be the best option for freestyle. Since the frame is the largest part of your drone, it's weight will play an important part in the all-up weight of your drone. Most frames designed for freestyle come in the weight range of 130g to 230g, and are built with freestyle in mind. We would recommend going for a frame that is light, but does not compromise on quality to reduce weight. Frame Thickness - The thicker the plates that make up a frame, the better it's strength and durability. Thicker frames (4-5mm thickness for arms and 2-3mm on the rest of the plates) tend to withstand impacts better, and last a lot longer than thinner frames. Thinner frames on the other hand (2-3mm thickness throughout) are lighter and faster, but also, most susceptible to damage upon impact. We recommend going for thicker frames for the first build (say 4 to 5mm) Material - Most modern frames are built using carbon fibre reinforced plastic (commonly referred to as Carbon Fibre frames in the community). We recommend going for frames that are built with 3K Carbon Fibre. See this post by GetFPV for a more in-depth understanding of materials used in drone frames. Arm configuration - The way the arms are designed also makes a lot of difference in terms of maintenance costs. For instance, some frames are come with linked arms while others come with arms that are individual and separate from each other. Linked arms have better stability, but add to maintenance costs where you would end up buying 2two arms even when you just need to replace one. Individual arms are great for replacement but aren't as stable as linked arms. We recommend frames that come with individual arms. Ease of Assembly/Replacement - Another important pointer to keep in mind would be the ease of build - how easy is it to build the frame or replace a part of the frame if damaged? Some frames are so well designed that they come with a layout that allows for easy assembly and can be quickly taken apart to replace an arm, say. However, some frames are designed without this in mind, and the pilot may have to take all the inner components apart in order to change an arm. This is not too high on the list of priorities, but if available, we recommend going for a drone that is easy to build. (Note that individual arms is a plus point when we think or ease of replacement of a frame) Additional/Optional attachments and mounts - Most frames do not usually come with custom additional parts for mounting uncommon parts. However, frames that come with a GoPro mount for instance, save the additional hassle of having to find or 3D print one, right? Here are some uncommon but essential mounting parts that frames usually do not come with: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 GoPro mount Antenna holder ( for antennas like the immortal - T or others ) GPS - Chip holder Custom air - unit holder for DJI based drones Motor protector mounts ( protect the underside of the motor mount ) Base - plate protector Power - cord fixed mount Mounting adapters for 20 mm / 30 . 5 mm ( in case the frame does not support one of the mounting sizes ) Arm Positions - Not very important, but sometimes (depending on the field-of-view of the FPV camera and the angle at which the arms are mounted on to the frame) the propellers come into the view of the camera and can obstruct proper viewing. This is not too much of a problem, but we would recommend getting a frame that has a camera mount which avoids the propellers from getting into the line-of-sight.","title":"Frame"},{"location":"01-introduction/drone-components/01-frame/_index.en.html#frames","text":"The frame is the main body of the drone.

We recommend going for frames that are built with 3K Carbon Fibre. See this post by GetFPV for a more in-depth understanding of materials used in drone frames. Arm configuration - The way the arms are designed also makes a lot of difference in terms of maintenance costs. For instance, some frames are come with linked arms while others come with arms that are individual and separate from each other. Linked arms have better stability, but add to maintenance costs where you would end up buying 2two arms even when you just need to replace one. Individual arms are great for replacement but aren't as stable as linked arms. We recommend frames that come with individual arms. Ease of Assembly/Replacement - Another important pointer to keep in mind would be the ease of build - how easy is it to build the frame or replace a part of the frame if damaged? Some frames are so well designed that they come with a layout that allows for easy assembly and can be quickly taken apart to replace an arm, say. However, some frames are designed without this in mind, and the pilot may have to take all the inner components apart in order to change an arm. This is not too high on the list of priorities, but if available, we recommend going for a drone that is easy to build. (Note that individual arms is a plus point when we think or ease of replacement of a frame) Additional/Optional attachments and mounts - Most frames do not usually come with custom additional parts for mounting uncommon parts. However, frames that come with a GoPro mount for instance, save the additional hassle of having to find or 3D print one, right? Here are some uncommon but essential mounting parts that frames usually do not come with: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 GoPro mount Antenna holder ( for antennas like the immortal - T or others ) GPS - Chip holder Custom air - unit holder for DJI based drones Motor protector mounts ( protect the underside of the motor mount ) Base - plate protector Power - cord fixed mount Mounting adapters for 20 mm / 30 . 5 mm ( in case the frame does not support one of the mounting sizes ) Arm Positions - Not very important, but sometimes (depending on the field-of-view of the FPV camera and the angle at which the arms are mounted on to the frame) the propellers come into the view of the camera and can obstruct proper viewing. This is not too much of a problem, but we would recommend getting a frame that has a camera mount which avoids the propellers from getting into the line-of-sight.","title":"Useful tips for choosing the right freestyle frames"},{"location":"01-introduction/drone-components/02-flight-controller/_index.en.html","text":"Flight Controller (FC) \u00b6 This is arguably one of the most critical parts of the drone. This is a piece of hardware that forms the heart of the drone. The FC is basically a mini computer that manages the way your drone flies. The flight controller usually has some firmware installed on it that allows it to make calculations and decisions by collecting telemetry and data from other parts of the drone and from sensors such as a gyro, GPS, accelerometers and more. The Flight Controller also connects to a radio receiver chip (RX) and accepts control input from the pilot who is flying the drone. It uses these radio signals from the RX to determine the way the pilot wants the drone to move, and makes it fly that way. The processing power of a flight controller determines the capabilities of the drone. An F4 is a common processor class that is a standard we see in many Flight Controllers today (example, the Mamba F405 comes with an F4 processor). F7 and H7 processor classes are more powerful and rapidly becoming the norm (example, Mamba F722 comes with an F7 processor).

The ESC is responsible for driving the motor in a drone, based on the power it gets from the battery and the signal that it gets from the flight controller.

However, we also have an option where a single ESC can do the job of four ESCs - called four-in-one ESC. Here's a 4-in-1 ESC : As you can see, a 4-in-one ESC has enough connection pads to connect all 4 motors to it. This means that it manages the power distribution for each individual motor quite well.

Let's take a look at the hobby drone-flying scene in India: What you should know \u00b6 The following rules apply irrespective of the category of the drone. If you own a drone (defined as an RPAS or Remotely Piloted Aircraft System on the site), you need to register it with the Government of India. This is a mandatory requirement, and is not optional. This applies to custom-made drones and to commercial drones as well. Drone regulations differ based on the total weight of your drone. Each drone category comes with it's own set of rules and regulations that we need to abide by (Scroll down to see a list of drone categories and their weight classifications). Registration can be done by logging-on to the DGCA Digital Sky WebSite . If you are planning to build a drone, or have a drone that you have built yourself, it still needs to be registered. Theres a section below that covers this scenario. At the moment, the drone regulations in India are being formulated. While some of the regulations are already in place, there are still loopholes and scenarios that have not been covered in detail. For instance, custom-built drones like the ones we build in this document do not comply with NPNT and DGCA recognizes them as non-NPNT drones. Pilots cannot request for a UIN for these drones at the moment. The best course of action in this scenario is to stay as compliant as logically possible. Scroll down for more details on this specific scenario. Drone Categories \u00b6 The following are the different categories recognized by the DGCA as of this time of writing: Category Weight Classification Nano Less than or equal to 250 grams. Micro Greater than 250 grams and less than or equal to 2 kg. Small Greater than 2 kg and less than or equal to 25 kg. Medium Greater than 25 kg and less than or equal to 150 kg. Large Greater than 150 kg. Primary Regulations \u00b6 Here are the main rules that you need to be aware of: Drone pilots need to register their drones before they attempt to fly them. Drones must not be flown higher than 200ft vertically off the ground. Drone pilots must always maintain line-of-sight with their drones when flying them. Drones cannot be flown in no-fly zones or controlled airspace (mostly places of national importance, military locations, airports, LoCs and so on). Drones should not be used to violate the privacy of others or to harm others in any way. Refer to this image for clarity (Taken from DGCA home Page ): In short, Regular Micro drones require UIN and the pilots need to adhere to the do's-and-dont's of flying RPAs. Nano pilots do not even need a UIN to fly. \u00b6 Nano drones \u00b6 These are drones with All Up Weight (AUW) of 250 grams or less. AUW includes any payload that the drone may be carrying. At the time of writing, Nano drones do not have any restrictive rules governing its use in India. These drones do not need to be registered. Note that a nano drone will be bumped up to the micro category if it's speed exceeds 15 meters per second or if it can fly farther than 100m from the pilot. The drone will also be bumped up to Micro category if it can fly higher than 15 feet off the ground level. Since we are primarily focused on Micro drones, this document focuses on that category alone. Micro Drones \u00b6 UIN Number \u00b6 To fly micro drones, you need to register the drone as mentioned above, and you need to obtain a UIN (Unique Identification Number) for the drone. This UIN number needs to be clearly indicated on the body of the drone. NPNT \u00b6 This drone needs to comply with NPNT rule. NPNT stand for No Permission No TakeOff, which is a system that allows a drone to fly only if the drone pilot has been granted permission for a flight. This is a complicated requirement that requires your drone to have a GPS GLONASS chip and a SIM, allowing the drone be tracked and monitored. This particular regulation is pretty hard to achieve for us, and we will be attempting this compliance only after large-scale adoption and support for this requirement in the drone building world. RTH System & GeoFencing Capabilities \u00b6 Drones in the Micro category need to be equipped with the automated capability to return back to the pilot if they enter restricted airspace (also known as Controlled Airspace) or places that they are not supposed to be flown into. This too is a complicated requirement for us to achieve and we will be attempting this compliance only after large-scale adoption and support for this requirement in the drone building world. Flight Records and Logbooks \u00b6 Drone pilots are required to maintain clear and concise records of their flight sessions, including information about flight locations, flight time, and other flight metrics. This is a manual requirement that each pilot needs to adhere to and is not in scope for our document. What about a drone that you build yourself \u00b6 We intend to build our own drones instead of buying RTF (ready-to-fly) drones. In our case, our drone build is going to be in the micro category. The DGCA Digital Sky platform recognizes us as a drone manufacturer, and we need to register by operating under this assumption. Since we build our own drones, we will provide our own serial numbers for each drone we register. Thankfully, this is allowed and perfectly legal to do so. Custom-made Micro Drones & the Regulations that currently govern them \u00b6 Drones that fall under the micro category need to be enlisted in the drone enlistment site, and as mentioned above, need to have a UIN. However, custom-built micro drones do not have the ability today to be NPNT compliant. As on 15 th of April 2021, pilots cannot apply for a UIN for these drones. This is a temporary state-of-affairs that we expect to change soon. However, what can be done about this situation? When asked, the DGCA response has been as under: Please be informed that as your drone is self-made drone it comes under non-NPNT drone, so enlistment is the only process for non-NPNT drone. We would request you to do the enlistment. Then you will get an OAN (Owner Acknowledgement Number) and DAN(Drone Acknowledgement Number). And for the next process wait for further announcement from DGCA.

These parts come in all shapes and sizes, and we need to make sure that they are compatible with each other. In order to effectively achieve a stable solid and strong build, a few basic minimum tools are needed. Here's a list of them all Soldering Iron \u00b6 One of the most important tools that one needs when building a drone is a soldering iron. With quads, many different components need to be connected to the flight controller or the ESC. For instance, the four motors need to be connected to the ESC, the radio module and the camera need to be connected to the flight controller, and so on. These connections need to be strong and withstand vibrations and shocks. Soldering is the best way to achieve this. Any soldering iron with a wattage of 60W would suit well, although it is recommended to go for one that allows for varying the temperature. This is particularly important because heat is an enemy to electronic components. Being able to increase or reduce the temperature allows to work with small and large soldering jobs. Soldering tips \u00b6 The type of soldering tip is also an important factor to consider when working on any soldering job. For most soldering jobs, two types of tips are most commonly used: Conical Tip - Used in soldering jobs that need high precision. These are the most versatile of the lot and usable in many situations. Bevel Tip - These tips have a large flat surface that allows to deliver more heat. Usually used for soldering jobs for large joins. Recommendation \u00b6 Here are some notable soldering irons you could go for.

SL Model name Manufacturer Link to buy 1 TS100 Miniware AliExpress 2 SQ-001 (TS-100 clone) Sequre AliExpress 3 SQ-D60B Sequre InsideFPV As for tips, we recommend using the TS-BC2 and TS-C4 tips. Solder Wire \u00b6 Solder wire is an integral component used as the binding medium in soldering joins. Solder is an alloy made by combining two metals (usually Tin [Sn] and Lead [Pb]). We recommend using good quality solder with a rosin core. Rosin core solder wire includes a thin core of rosin material which acts as flux for the soldering process. 60-40 Sn-Pb solder wire \u00b6 This is the most commonly found solder wire blend available in India. We recommend going for this blend instead of the lead-free version of solder wire. Also, we highly recommend going for this blend with a rosin core to include a bit of flux into the soldering process to make a better join. Utectic Solder Wire (63/37 Sn/Pb) \u00b6 Solder wire also comes in a special blend of 63% tin and 37% lead. This solder wire is called Eutectic solder. While the regular 60-40 blend of solder usually exhibits a variance in solidifying and melting temperature points, utectic solder possesses a single (usually low) melting and solidifying temperature point. This allows for better and more accurate soldering results. Eutectic solder wire is very rarely found in India. Most available products are imported ones made by Kester or other reputable brands. Allen Keys set \u00b6 A simple set of allen keys is always valuable. Allen keys allow to quickly work with screws or bolts which have hexagonal heads/sockets. These are cheap and available almost everywhere. Dual-sided tape \u00b6 Dual sided tape is an absolute essential item in the hobbyist's arsenal. These come handy in a variety of situations where we need to ensure that components stay in their designated spots on the drone and don't come off. These come in various widths, sizes and bonding strengths. We recommend going for 3M dual-sided tape.

With quads, many different components need to be connected to the flight controller or the ESC. For instance, the four motors need to be connected to the ESC, the radio module and the camera need to be connected to the flight controller, and so on. These connections need to be strong and withstand vibrations and shocks. Soldering is the best way to achieve this. Any soldering iron with a wattage of 60W would suit well, although it is recommended to go for one that allows for varying the temperature. This is particularly important because heat is an enemy to electronic components. Being able to increase or reduce the temperature allows to work with small and large soldering jobs.","title":"Soldering Iron"},{"location":"01-introduction/tools-needed/_index.en.html#soldering-tips","text":"The type of soldering tip is also an important factor to consider when working on any soldering job.

The drone will be capable of a 3-5 minute flight time with a 1300mah LiPo battery and a GoPro attached. The parts \u00b6 For this build we will use the following parts: TBS Source One v3 Frame - This is a sturdy frame that is tested and used by a lot of FPV pilots. Comes with 5mm thick arms and a simple yet effective design. While we have multiple options available, this one is a good starter frame with support for 20x20 and 30x30 TMotor Pacer v2 2207 1950KV motors - TMotor makes some of the best brushless DC motors out there and their Pacer v2 lineup will do well for our build. Since this is a freestyle 6S build, we are going with these 1950KV motors. Aikon F7 2020 v3 HD Flight Controller - One of the best FCs out there, the AIkon F7 HD v3 comes with an F7 processor, 5 UARTs, dedicated LED pads (although we wont be using those in this build), On-board high overhead voltage regulators (50V Peak voltage) and a JST connector dedicated to the CaddX Vista or DJI Air Unit (hence the HD tag). All of this comes in a small 20x20 form factor. Aikon AK32 Pro 50A 4-in-1 ESC - With an Aikon FC chosen for this build, its only natural to go for an ESC made by Aikon. This is a powerful 50A ESC, and works well with the AIkon FC we have chosen. This is a 6S capable ESC, and comes with BLHeli_32 firmware & programmable PWM frequency up to 96KHz. CaddX Vista Nebula Pro Kit - For a freestyle drone that we intend to use in relatively close range sessions, a full sized Air Unit may not be the best idea. The Vista Nebula Pro kit comes with the Nebula Pro camera and is lighter and suits our requirements well. The Source One Frame has enough space at the back to accommodate the Vista. This back-placement works well for us as we want to mount the Vista's antenna at the back of the frame. The iFlight mini 5.8GHz Antenna (slightly better than the Cherry/CaddX stock antenna that comes with the Vista) is what we will go with for this build. TBS CrossFire Nano Rx - The famed CrossFire protocol is one of the best long-distance protocols out there today. The Nano Rx receiver paired with an immortal-T antenna will ensure that the drone will never failsafe in the short distances (1-2 Km) that we intend to fly with this drone. Warning IMPORTANT If you have a DJI controller, you should be aware that the DJI Air Unit & the CaddX Vista are capable of transmitting Video AND control Signals between your controller and the drone. In other words, your drone can be controlled through the Air Unit/Vista without needing a dedicated receiver. If you have the DJI controller, you do not need a dedicated Rx for your drone like the one we are using here (the TBS CrossFire Nano Rx) This however, does not mean that you cannot use CrossFire if you want to. If you like, you can build the drone the way we will in this guide, with the CrossFire Nano Rx receiver. However, you will need a different controller (with a CrossFire Module) as the DJI version wont work with CrossFire. GemFan Durable 3 Blade Propellers - Often ignored/underestimated, propellers are crucial parts of the drone (obviously! Just try flying without them). The GemFan props that we are going with are 5 inch props with a pitch of 4.2 inches. Tools and other resources \u00b6 Apart from the drone parts we listed above, we will need a few tools and consumables: Soldering Iron Solder Silicone wires of various colors Bolts, nuts and washers (usually provided with the motors and the frame) Dual-sided tape Hex Drivers of m2 and m3 size Digital Multimeter (Fluke 115, for instance) Nylon zip ties Heat-shrink tubing of various sizes These tools are explained in detail in the Tools Section of this documentation project","title":"Part 01 - Getting it all together"},{"location":"03-build-guide/part-1/_index.en.html#drone-build-guide---part-1","text":"","title":"Drone Build Guide - Part 1"},{"location":"03-build-guide/part-1/_index.en.html#getting-it-all-together","text":"This is a comprehensive drone build guide where we will go step-by-step to build a 5-inch freestyle drone.

Warning IMPORTANT If you have a DJI controller, you should be aware that the DJI Air Unit & the CaddX Vista are capable of transmitting Video AND control Signals between your controller and the drone. In other words, your drone can be controlled through the Air Unit/Vista without needing a dedicated receiver. If you have the DJI controller, you do not need a dedicated Rx for your drone like the one we are using here (the TBS CrossFire Nano Rx) This however, does not mean that you cannot use CrossFire if you want to. If you like, you can build the drone the way we will in this guide, with the CrossFire Nano Rx receiver. However, you will need a different controller (with a CrossFire Module) as the DJI version wont work with CrossFire. GemFan Durable 3 Blade Propellers - Often ignored/underestimated, propellers are crucial parts of the drone (obviously! Just try flying without them). The GemFan props that we are going with are 5 inch props with a pitch of 4.2 inches.","title":"The parts"},{"location":"03-build-guide/part-1/_index.en.html#tools-and-other-resources","text":"Apart from the drone parts we listed above, we will need a few tools and consumables: Soldering Iron Solder Silicone wires of various colors Bolts, nuts and washers (usually provided with the motors and the frame) Dual-sided tape Hex Drivers of m2 and m3 size Digital Multimeter (Fluke 115, for instance) Nylon zip ties Heat-shrink tubing of various sizes These tools are explained in detail in the Tools Section of this documentation project","title":"Tools and other resources"},{"location":"03-build-guide/part-10/_index.en.html","text":"Drone Capabilities \u00b6","title":"Drone Capabilities"},{"location":"03-build-guide/part-10/_index.en.html#drone-capabilities","text":"","title":"Drone Capabilities"},{"location":"03-build-guide/part-2/_index.en.html","text":"Drone Build Guide - Part 2 \u00b6 Coming Soon \u00b6","title":"Part 02 - Building the frame"},{"location":"03-build-guide/part-2/_index.en.html#drone-build-guide---part-2","text":"","title":"Drone Build Guide - Part 2"},{"location":"03-build-guide/part-2/_index.en.html#coming-soon","text":"","title":"Coming Soon"},{"location":"03-build-guide/part-3/_index.en.html","text":"Drone Capabilities \u00b6","title":"Drone Capabilities"},{"location":"03-build-guide/part-3/_index.en.html#drone-capabilities","text":"","title":"Drone Capabilities"},{"location":"03-build-guide/part-4/_index.en.html","text":"Drone Capabilities \u00b6","title":"Drone Capabilities"},{"location":"03-build-guide/part-4/_index.en.html#drone-capabilities","text":"","title":"Drone Capabilities"},{"location":"03-build-guide/part-5/_index.en.html","text":"Drone Capabilities \u00b6","title":"Drone Capabilities"},{"location":"03-build-guide/part-5/_index.en.html#drone-capabilities","text":"","title":"Drone Capabilities"},{"location":"03-build-guide/part-6/_index.en.html","text":"Drone Capabilities \u00b6","title":"Drone Capabilities"},{"location":"03-build-guide/part-6/_index.en.html#drone-capabilities","text":"","title":"Drone Capabilities"},{"location":"03-build-guide/part-7/_index.en.html","text":"Drone Capabilities \u00b6","title":"Drone Capabilities"},{"location":"03-build-guide/part-7/_index.en.html#drone-capabilities","text":"","title":"Drone Capabilities"},{"location":"03-build-guide/part-8/_index.en.html","text":"Drone Capabilities \u00b6","title":"Drone Capabilities"},{"location":"03-build-guide/part-8/_index.en.html#drone-capabilities","text":"","title":"Drone Capabilities"},{"location":"03-build-guide/part-9/_index.en.html","text":"Drone Capabilities \u00b6","title":"Drone Capabilities"},{"location":"03-build-guide/part-9/_index.en.html#drone-capabilities","text":"","title":"Drone Capabilities"},{"location":"04-resources/bibliography/_index.en.html","text":"Bibliography \u00b6 This page contains references and links to resources we have referred to when we built this documentation SL Link Description 01 link FAQ page in the Digital Sky Government Site 02 link 03 link 04 link 05 link 06 link 07 link 08 link 09 link 10 link 11 link 12 link","title":"Bibliography"},{"location":"04-resources/bibliography/_index.en.html#bibliography","text":"This page contains references and links to resources we have referred to when we built this documentation SL Link Description 01 link FAQ page in the Digital Sky Government Site 02 link 03 link 04 link 05 link 06 link 07 link 08 link 09 link 10 link 11 link 12 link","title":"Bibliography"},{"location":"04-resources/drone-configs/_index.en.html","text":"Welcome to MkDocs \u00b6 For full documentation visit mkdocs.org .
